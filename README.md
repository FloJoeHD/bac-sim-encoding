# bac-sim-QBF-encoding
A simple python script that generates a textfile which includes the encoding of the Sim game as a QBF formula.

This can be then further processed with a QBF-Solver to get a solution for the formula if there is one.

The structure is as follows:
* ``encoding_gen.py`` contains the generator for the whole QBF formula
* ``encoding_one_step.py`` is a debug/test generator which currently generates 1 or 2 game steps as a QBF formula
* ``output_web was the output of limboole web interface of a formula which still contained errors (so not relevant anymore)
* ``sim_encoding.boole`` is the whole QBF formula for the game as textfile in PCNF, generated by ``encoding_gen.py``
* ``testOneStep.boole`` is the QBF formula generated by ``encoding_one_step.py``
